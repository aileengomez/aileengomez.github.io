        <h1>What makes Essential Oils so popular?</h1>
        <p>It can't be denied that no matter where you turn on social media or which health blog you follow, you will find a post raving about essential oils and their many benefits. But what exactly are essential oils and what are their many <a href="howtouse.html">uses</a>?</p>
        <p>An essential oil is a concentrated liquid containing aromatic and other beneficial compounds from plants. ðŸŒ±ðŸŒ»ðŸŒ¾ <br> The oil contains the "essence of" the plant's fragranceâ€”the characteristic fragrance of the plant from which it is derived.</p>
        <p>Essential oils have been around for thousand of years; as early as atleast 5,000 years ago. Some of the earliest recorded uses of essential oils came from Ancient Egypt. They are referenced numerous times in Jewish religious texts and the Holy Bible. Essential oils have resurfaced due to the increase in interest in living a more chemical free, holistic lifestyle.</p>
        <p>They offer a variety of benefits ranging from cosmetic and dietary purposes to spiritual and religious purposes and have been used medicinally. They are also really great to use in household cleaning products in place of the many toxic products out on the market. Find recipes <a href="recipes.html">here</a> to make your own.</p>
