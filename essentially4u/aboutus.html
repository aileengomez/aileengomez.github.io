            <img src="images/cynthia.png" />
            <p>Welcome to the world of Young Living essential oils! I promise you will not be disappointed.</p>
            <p>I was first introduced to essential oils, particularly Young Living oils at a home school convention about four years ago. The presenter offered classes on oils, aromatherapy and a free rain drop technique with the purchase of a starter kit. I was instantly drawn to just how quickly I noticed a difference in how I felt overall. I had arrived feeling under the weather and fatigued but felt like a brand new person after the treatment. As they say, "the rest is history"!</p>
            <p>Essential oils have become a huge part of my everyday life and home. I stand by the quality of Young Living's oils and am passionate about sharing all that I've learned with you. Please reach out. I am here to help.</p>

            <p>As a massage therapist I am no stranger to essential oils and the benefits of aromatherapy. I had tried many other brands for years before my sister Cynthia introduced me to the superior quality of Young Living's oils.</p>
            <p>My first experience with Young Living was using their peppermint oil to help alleviate a migraine I was having. Not only did the migraine clear up immediately but it left me shocked that I no longer needed to take medication for it.</p> 
            <p>This made me dig deeper into Young living oils and ultimately what sold me is their Seed to Seal guarantee, which makes them powerful and effective (learn more <a href="https://www.youngliving.com/en_US/discover/seed-to-seal" target="_blank">here</a>). Their quality just can't be beat. But don't take my word for it. Try them out by purchasing a starter kit.</p>

            <h2>MELISSA BLANCO</h2>
            <img src="images/melissa.jpg" />
            <p>I first got into essential oils and Young Living after my sisters Cynthia and Melanie recommended I try them. The more they learned about the oils the more they shared recipes and knowledge of their many uses. This catapulted me further and created a foundation for me to learn more to create my own recipes for use at home and with my family.</p> 
            <p>At the time I had been gradually removing personal and cleaning products made with toxic ingredients from my life and home. I noticed changes in myself and my kids immediately from using the oil blends and recipes my sister Melanie would give me to try. Essential oils became a game changer for me.</p>
            <p>What I love about the oils is how creative you can get when it comes to the many things they can be used for. Don't worry if you don't have the creative bug, Young Living has you covered with the many products they offer comprised of their superior quality oils. You can get anything from laundry detergent to toothpaste. Try them out today!</p>
